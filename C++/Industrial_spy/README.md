Here is my solution to a programming task I found on open.kattis.com

The description of the problem can be found here:

https://open.kattis.com/problems/industrialspy

Shortly put, the problem is that you get a number, and the task is to find the number
of primes you can make with that number. So for instance if you get the number 17, you can
make 3 primes from that, namely 7, 17 and 71. The solution to this problem can solve this task
for any given number up to 7 digits.

to compile the code use a c++ compiler. I used GNU's compiler, and thus I compiled it with the command:

>g++ Industrial_spy

from this compilation you get a file called a.exe. Run the program a.

When you run the program it will immediatly ask you to input how many numbers you want to test for. 
It will then ask you to input a number to be solved. The program will output the number of primes that
can be made from the number you gave.

I made this program in december 2017.
