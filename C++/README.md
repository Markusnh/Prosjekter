I have done quite some programming on my spare time in C++, and know the syntax quite well
The problems I have done in C++ is mostly from the webpage open.kattis.com, where you
can find problems and upload your solution to them and check if you have solved it correctly

I have not taken any subjects where we use C++, all my knowledge from C++ is self taught
