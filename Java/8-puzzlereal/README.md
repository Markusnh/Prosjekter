This project implements an algorithm to solve an 8-puzzle using the A* algorithm. 
It uses an Heuristic function (A function saying how far away it is from the correct solution)
and uses breadt-first search to find the quickest solution to solve the puzzle. If
There are no solutions the final print to the terminal will be false, after it has run
701 steps

to run the program simply write in the terminal in this directory:

>java Test

if the files are not compiled first, they need to be compiled, this can be done with:

>javac *.java
