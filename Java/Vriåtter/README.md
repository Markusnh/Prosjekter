This project implements the classic cardgame: VriÃ¥tter.

When you run the program (instruction on how below) you will
first need to enter the number of players and the names of them.
After that the game begins, and a round always starts by saying what the visible card is
and which players turn it is. You are presented with that players hand, which lists up all
the cards, with a number besides the card. to play a card, simply enter the number of the card
you want to play and press enter. If the card was playe\able it will immediatly go to the next
player. You can only play cards that either match the colour or the number of the visible card.
You can pass up to three times, and thus get three new cards per round, before the round goes to the next person.

I made this program while taking the course IN1010 - introduction to java and object oriented programming in 2017. 


to run the code/game you have to compile the java files first. You can do this the following way(tested for java version 15.0.2):
(to run the two commands you have to be in the same directory as the files)

>javac *.java


To run the game after that simply write the following command:

>java Game
