This project implements an algorithm to solve an 8-puzzle using the A* algorithm. 
It uses an Heuristic function (A function saying how far away it is from the correct solution)
and uses breadt-first search to find the quickest solution to solve the puzzle. If
There are no solutions the final print to the terminal will be false, after it has run
701 steps

to run the program it needs to be compiled first, which can be done with
the following command:

>javac *.java

After that the program can be run with the following command:

>java Test
