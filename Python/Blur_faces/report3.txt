Report 3:

Blur_1.py used around 7.1 seconds to blur the image, blur_2.py used 0.03 seconds. By running blur_3.py(using numba) three times 
we get an average time of around 0.5 seconds. That is 14.2 times faster than the standard python implementation and 16.6 times slower 
than the numpy implementation. 

To use the numpy implementation the problem that is going to be solved has to be possible to do by matrix or vector calculation, probably not
all problems can be solved this way. And if it is possible it may be a bit more difficoult to do than the standard python way. 

Solving it with Numba is very easy, it is just to use the Jit function as decorator for a function implemented
in the standard python way. Thus the complexity of using Numba is far less than Numpy, even though it actually may be more difficoult
to debug using Numba, since the errors one get is not always that helpfull, if one get an error message at all.

In conclusion, Numpy is faster but a wee bit more complex. Numba is not as fast as numpy, but also less complex to implement.
